# Guess_the_Number
In this repository I have made a Number guessing game in Python Language. 
I read in class 8th and I am from India. Today is 12th July 2021 and today I have made this game.

About the game:

In this program you have to guess a random number that is generated by the computer. 
If you have guessed a number which is smaller than the actual number, then it says that - You guessed it wrong! Enter a larger number.
If you guessed a number which is larger than the actual number, then it says that - You guessed it wrong! Enter a smaller number.
And if you guessed the right number, then it tells the number of guesses you used to arrive at the actual number.

Thats it.. Play the game and Enjoy..
